# ðŸ‘‘ todo's

<!-- comments will hidden from `todo show` -->

- [x] try nimgrep before grep
- [ ] combine env variable and file config

## Bugs

- [ ] exit gracefully instead of attempting to access index that doesn't exist

## Stable

- [-] commit helper -> `todo commit`
- [x] add a quiet flag to show, so it doesn't suggest todo edit
- [x] fully implement working directory pattern

## Future improvements

Future version may incorporate an offshoot module built off `markdown` that more directly parses and styles the text

- [ ] support some basic inline markdown: bold, italic, strikethrough, code
